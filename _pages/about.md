I am a second-year master’s student at the [University of Science and Technology, Beijing](https://www.ustb.edu.cn/), majoring in Optical Fiber Sensing. However, I have a strong passion for AI-related content, particularly in 2D and 3D AIGC.  I am especially fascinated by 3D mesh and digital human-related technologies.
In 2023, I briefly studied Diffusion and then fine-tuned LoRA for Stable Diffusion. As for the [results](https://github.com/RuiqingTang/sd_lora_study), let's just say they were... not presentable, haha!

In 2024, I began exploring 3D AIGC and digital human-related technologies. This field involves a wide range of technologies, and most of my time has been spent reproducing open-source algorithms. Of course, I haven’t been modifying models or datasets and retraining them from scratch, as I don’t have access to sufficient GPU resources, nor do I have a mentor to guide me through the process.

Up to now, I have explored various fields: text-to-motion, motion capture, music-to-dance, interaction with scenes, automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), singing voice conversion (SVC), music generation, 3D avatar animation, auto-rigging, mesh generation, eye tracking, and gesture recognition......
I don’t consider myself a dedicated algorithm developer, but fortunately, I possess strong engineering skills, which make it relatively easy for me to reproduce and implement open-source algorithms.

I think [this outcome](https://youtu.be/z8XGXPcp_5k?si=hWQLo2531hkO04-N) is quite impressive—using music to generate 3D dance motions (SMPL data), then converting them into VMD animations (or alternatively, FBX or BVH formats), and finally driving the PMX model to animate. I have also published it on other platforms: [rednotes](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/discovery/item/67cbdd36000000000e005416?source=webshare&xhsshare=pc_web&xsec_token=ABT23s92SHRGg6EHT0gRCOq_UYBaztvinbD5yuVOpyJJs=&xsec_source=pc_share), [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1DS99Y2Ei8/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=2cb3b7dea2b9d6e5fd1c199158d16e4f).
